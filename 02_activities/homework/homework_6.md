After reading about Pakistan’s NADRA family-based registration system, I realized how critical it is to consider diverse use cases when designing databases. A system that only accounts for traditional family structures can fail to accommodate individuals without registered parents, or those from unique communities with different familial arrangements. This example underscores that database systems are not just about tables and logical connections but also require a deep understanding of social, economic, political, and community contexts. In any database design, it is essential to consider all possible requirements, from business logic to cultural nuances, before moving forward with development. Asking the right questions and conducting thorough interviews are crucial steps toward building an inclusive and ethical system.

Additionally, the role of human factors in AI and ML makes us reflect on the limitations of machines. Simple tasks like sewing or loading a washing machine, which humans find intuitive, can be highly complex for machines. It's important to remember that today’s technology exists thanks to human ingenuity, and machines are not outpacing us—they’re tools we control. On the ethical front, it’s crucial to acknowledge that AI can inherit human biases, as the people who design these systems are inherently biased. Reducing bias in AI is a key challenge that must be addressed thoughtfully. Although this is a controversial topic, I remain optimistic about the future of AI and its potential to benefit society if developed responsibly.

**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.
